lsb (3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload lsb 3.1 support for unstable.
  * Really create ld-lsb-x86-64.so.3 symlink.  (Closes: #355959)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Apr 2006 14:22:14 -0400

lsb (3.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First crack at a package for LSB 3.1.

  * Update README.Debian and control file for 3.1.
  * Update lsb_release to recognize lsb-desktop and lsb-qt4 modules.
  * Update FSF address in debian/copyright.
  * Fix debian/control to allow sarge build.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Mar 2006 16:11:45 -0500

lsb (3.0-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add ld-linux-x64-64.so.3 symlink on AMD64.  (Closes: #355959)
  * Depends: ia32-libs -> libc6-i386, lib32z1 on AMD64.  (Closes: #355388)
  * On purge or upgrade from < lsb-release 3.0-8, remove /etc/lsb-release
    if its md5sum is the same as that shipped in sarge.  (Closes: #355377)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Mar 2006 01:14:05 -0500

lsb (3.0-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Test $TERM in log_use_fancy_output; if it is "dumb" we don't have a
    fancy TTY.  (Closes: #350291)
  * Better heuristics in lsb_release to guess whether we're running on
    testing or unstable.  (Closes: #95824, #341231)
    Note that /etc/lsb-release, if present, will override these results,
    and /etc/debian_version has priority.
  * Fix lsb_release to allow multiple fields to be displayed (i.e.
    lsb_release --id --codename).

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Jan 2006 18:24:49 -0500

lsb (3.0-14) unstable; urgency=low

lsb (3.0-13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "answer all the questions in the changelog" release.
  * Skip empty headers when parsing RFC822 headers for init scripts.
    (Closes: #343310)
  * The versioned dependency on dpkg-dev is due to the use of
    DEB_*_ARCH_CPU in debian/rules, which only became available in dpkg
    1.13.2.  Feel free to submit a patch to facilitate a sarge backport.
    (Closes: #344392)
  * Since the lsb family of packages track an upstream specification with
    "non-native" version numbering, the use of a hyphenated version number
    for these native packages is justified.  (Closes: #344384)
    (Note that although it does violate policy for a non-native package to
    lack a hyphen in its version number, the contrapositive case does not
    violate policy.)
  * Deal with missing /etc/debian_version.  (Closes: #341719)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Dec 2005 03:50:44 -0500

  * s/log_action_start_msg/log_action_begin_msg/ in README.Debian.
    (Thanks to Marco d'Itri for pointing these two out.)
  * If bits of /etc/lsb-release are missing (but not the whole file), use
    detected information in its place.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Sep 2005 19:16:00 -0400

lsb (3.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bring in lsb-release (binary) package; rewritten to handle -v properly
    for LSB 2.x and beyond.
  * /etc/lsb-release is no longer provided by the lsb-release package;
    it is probably best managed in base-files (which derived distros are
    probably branding anyway).

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Sep 2005 20:53:37 -0400

lsb (3.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update lsb-core dependencies to include:
      ed (for /bin/ed)
      bsdutils (for /usr/bin/logger)
      cupsys-client | lprng (for /usr/bin/lp)
      mailutils | mailx (for /usr/bin/mailx)
    These are required in the final LSB 3.0 spec.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Sep 2005 18:08:33 -0400

lsb (3.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add ld-lsb.so.3 symlinks.  (Closes: #326609)
  * Use cat $pidfile instead of read.  (Closes: #327405)
    If someone knows why the convoluted read was used instead... let me know.
  * Test for TPUT and friends as needed.  (Closes: #327388, #327825)
  * Add log_action_*().  (Closes: #324983)
  * Edit README.Debian; fork off a README.Debian for lsb-base.
    (Closes: #327525)
  * The log_* functions can be overridden in /etc/lsb-base-logging.sh.
    (Closes: #321963)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Sep 2005 19:32:29 -0400

  * Document usage of log_*_msg in README.Debian.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Aug 2005 12:00:57 -0500

lsb (3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable, since glibc 2.3.5 is now in.
  * lsb-base is now Priority: important.
  * Fix $FANCYTTY tests in a more POSIXly-correct way.  (Closes: #322022)
  * Get rid of the html/* stuff and references to it in README.Debian.
    (Closes: #321260)
  * Maintainers who are using the lsb-base logging facilities should
    *strongly* consider using log_daemon_msg() instead of log_start_msg();
    the new log_daemon_msg() is designed to meet both Debian and Ubuntu
    logging requirements.  Customization should come in a subsequent 3.0-x
    release.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Aug 2005 15:58:45 -0500

lsb (3.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add /usr/lib/lsb/lsbinstall.
    Note: the inetd stuff isn't implemented yet.
  * Require glibc >> 2.3.5, since some interfaces in LSB 3.0 were
    introduced by glibc 2.3.5.
  * Require Python 2.3 or later, so we can use optparse.
  * Fix test in pidofproc in /lib/lsb/init-functions.  (Closes: #315067)

  * Kludge log_*_msg into being more policy-compliant and (in the case of
    the LSB functions) more Debian-like.
  * Add log_progress_msg.  See spiffy example adapted from the Policy
    Manual in init-functions.  (Closes: #319739)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Aug 2005 22:45:41 -0500

  * Merge /lib/lsb/init-functions from Ubuntu.
  * Split /lib/lsb/init-functions into arch-all lsb-base package; this
    functionality is thus available for use by other, non-LSB packages.
  * Update README.Debian.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Mar 2005 17:42:11 -0600

lsb (2.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.  (Closes: #278093)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Oct 2004 19:50:00 -0500

lsb (2.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Upload to experimental so we don't break lsb 2.0-1 in unstable as it
    tries to migrate to sarge.
  * Split into lsb-core, lsb-graphics, and lsb-cxx packages, leaving lsb
    as a metapackage (lsb-graphics and lsb-cxx are also metapackages).
  * Include /lib64 in the AMD64 package rather than running mkdir in the
    postinst.
  * Revise README.Debian for LSB 2.0 and the package split; ensure LSB
    package install instructions are in the first page of text.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Sep 2004 21:38:36 -0500

lsb (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

lsb (1.3-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Conflict with libutahglx1 instead of depending on xlibmesa3-gl.
    This will allow XFree86 4.3.0's libgl1 to be installed on the system.
  * Move conflicts with Python to 2.5, since 2.4 is not expected to be
    backwards incompatible with anything in the lsb package.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Nov 2003 12:02:01 -0600

lsb (1.3-6) unstable; urgency=medium

    relative to the cwd, use it rather than prepending /etc/init.d.
    (Closes: #207851)
  * Added notes for backporting to woody to README.Debian.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Nov 2003 10:05:29 -0600

lsb (1.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note in README.Debian that the --lsbsysinit option in /etc/crontab is
    required for strict LSB compliance.  (Closes: #214896)
  * Re-enable $netdaemons facility in the "internal registry" again, as
    gLSB 1.1 included it and some packages appear to still use it.
    (Closes: #210578)
  * Use ld.so.1 symlink instead of the glibc-version-dependent location
    for s390.  (Closes: #216824)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Oct 2003 13:17:25 -0500

  Tobias Burnus:
  * Provide a skeleton LSB init script.  (Closes: #207715)
  * Numerous improvements to init-functions.  (Closes: #207639)
  Me:
  * Support broken uses of install_initd and remove_initd.

lsb (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release of LSB 1.3 for Debian.
  * Convert everything to Python 2.2+ style.
  * Clean up the parsing of header lines to be fully compliant.
  * Add po-debconf patch.  (Closes: #186853)
  * Don't retry if a signal specified in killproc.  (Closes: #167759)
  * Revise pidofproc to return a failure code if no pid found.
    (Closes: #190719)
  * Properly treat Required-Start and Required-Stop as strict dependencies
    (install_initd will now fail if they cannot be fulfilled.)
  * remove_initd will now fail if removing the init script would cause
    another LSB package to be missing a dependency.  (However, the
    tracking for these dependencies was not done in the past.  As this is
    part of gLSB 1.9, this should not be a problem.)
  * The previous two items were in a single report.  (Closes: #198293)
  * Support Should-Start and Should-Stop from gLSB 1.9.  (Closes: #198277)
    (A warning message will be output if a facility requested is unavailable.)
  * Support -p argument to killproc, pidofproc and start_daemon, per gLSB 1.9.
    (Closes: #197794)
  * Set up the ld-lsb symlink in the postinst, so it can vary between
    architectures, and remove in the prerm.  (Closes: #183617)
    Currently only defined for IA32 (i386), PPC32 (powerpc) and S390
    (s390); please let me know the correct link for IA64 (ia64) and any
    other ports that may be floating out there.  (I'm only interested in
    architectures that appear at http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/.)
  * Purge the lsb registry on package removal.
  * Depend on mawk | gawk; original-awk may not be SUS-compliant.
    (See http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/refspecs/LSB_1.3.0/gLSB/gLSB/awk.html)

    - $time: start >= S24, stop <= K21
    - $portmap: start >= S19, stop <= K34
  * Removed support for the $netdaemons facility, which vanished from the
    specification.  Hopefully nobody is using it...
  * Call pidof if it's available and /var/run/$1.pid doesn't exist.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Jul 2002 19:48:35 -0500

lsb (1.1.0-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note that Debian's run-parts ignores certain lsb cron.* scripts, in
    violation of the LSB specification.  See #118646.
    (If necessary, run-parts may be diverted by this package to conform.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Apr 2002 02:25:51 -0500

  * Improve error handing in {install,remove}_initd when no argument is
    specified.
  * Fix minor syntax error in outputing the facilities file.
  * Move facilities file handling into the initdutils module.
  * Changed facilities file format to allow multiple init scripts to
    provide the same facility w/o crashing.
  * These changes should solve all the init script handing bugs; thanks to
    Tobias Burnus <tburnus@physik.fu-berlin.de> for his testing.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Mar 2002 20:40:50 -0600

lsb (1.1.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include /usr/X11R6/bin to make the LSB test suite happy.  Document
    LSB's lack of specification of an X server or any clients as required
    for compliance (hence making it odd that /usr/X11R6/bin would be
    needed, as it could conceivably be empty).  (Closes: #136713)
  * Prompt on installation if shadow passwords appear to be disabled, and
    enable them if requested.  (Closes: #136806)
  * Fix the spelling of Matt Taggart's name in README.Debian.

lsb (1.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update README.Debian and install_initd to implement a few changes:
    - uid/gid for bin is documented.
    - treat RL 2-5 as the same, because nothing else sensible seems
